Bit manipulation
Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX School. It aims to learn about how to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators in C language.

Technologies
Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
C files are compiled using gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
C files are written according to the C90 standard
Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

Filename	Description
0-binary to uint.c	Converts a binary number to an unsigned int
1-print binary.c	Prints the binary representation of a number
2-get bit.c	Returns the value of a bit at a given index
3-set bit.c	Sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index
4-clear bit.c	Sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index
5-flip bits.c	Returns the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another
